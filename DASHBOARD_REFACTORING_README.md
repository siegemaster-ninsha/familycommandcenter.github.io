## Key Decisions

### State Management: Pinia ✓
- Vue 3-native
- Excellent modularity for widgets
- Smaller bundle size than Vuex
- Better DevTools support
- Can run alongside current system during migration

### Widget Storage: Backend API ✓
- Dashboard layouts stored via Account Settings API
- Enables cross-device synchronization
- LocalStorage as offline cache
- User-specific configurations

### Migration Strategy: Gradual ✓
- Both old and new systems run simultaneously
- Migrate one component at a time
- Test thoroughly before removing old code
- Can rollback individual features if needed

## FAQ

**Q: Why Pinia instead of Vuex?**
A: Pinia is Vue 3-native, has better TypeScript support, simpler API, and smaller bundle size. It's the recommended state management solution for Vue 3.

**Q: Why gradual migration?**
A: Gradual migration reduces risk, allows for thorough testing at each step, and ensures the app remains functional throughout the process.

**Q: Will this affect deployment?**
A: No! Both Pinia and Vuex work fine with GitHub Pages. It's all client-side JavaScript.

**Q: How long will this take?**
A: 8-12 weeks total, but the app remains functional throughout. Users won't notice the migration.

**Q: What if something breaks?**
A: The old system stays in place until Phase 5, allowing easy rollback. Each change is incremental and reversible.

**Q: Can we add new features during migration?**
A: Yes! New features should be built as widgets using the new system.
